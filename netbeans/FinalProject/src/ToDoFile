1) Secondary Sorting encapsulated in the Int+ValType [DONE]
1a) HPhase1 modified [DONE]
1b) HPhase5 modified [DONE]

2) Need to adjust the serialization/deserialiazation & printing/parsing
  of the Matrix Vector with the new syntax (row/column number). [DONE]
  ===>> SequenceOutputFormat can be used for intermedite data [DONE]
	All the MapReduce Phase must work with codified data [DONE]
	===>> Introduce the MAP-REDUCE internal representation [DONE]
		===>> Create MAP_REDUCE phase to convert from readable format to codified one [DONE]
		===>> Create MAP_REDUCE phase to convert from codified format to readable one [DONE]
  ===>> Adding the context variable k.

3) The C Phase4's parameter need to be invoked as a file name,
  instead of his directory [DONE]

4) Set the combiner Class to sppeed up the computations. [DONE]

5) Need to factorize all the phase to procede towards WPhase [DONE]

6) Test the project in distributed manner [DONE]

* Distributed Cache instead of reading from distributed File System [NONE]

Other Things:

* The X resulting matrix changes the effective size of the X should have Matrix:
	===> The problems arise when we are computing the Phase 5
	===> Unwanted Feature!!!
	(WE MUST TAKE CARE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FOLLOWING HPHASES)
	[SOLVED]
